# Marker-Motion-Tracking
Developed a motion tracking system using a setup of webcams and a Kinect camera. The prototype used ArUco markers in a configuration that allowed accurate 3D pose tracking. The algorithm for sensor fusion was developed to be used with varying system dimensions. OpenCV, ArUco and PyKinect libraries were utilized.
